/**
 * This implements the calculator evaluation logic.
 * Logically this maintains a signed integer indexed set of expressions, one of which
 * is distinguished as the main expression.
 * The main expression is constructed and edited with append(), delete(), etc.
 * An evaluation can then be started with a call to evaluateAndNotify() or requireResult().
 * This starts an asynchronous computation, which requests display of the initial result, when
 * available.  When initial evaluation is complete, it calls the associated listener's
 * onEvaluate() method.  This occurs in a separate event, possibly quite a bit later.  Once a
 * result has been computed, and before the underlying expression is modified, the
 * stringGet(index) method may be used to produce Strings that represent approximations to various
 * precisions.
 *
 * Actual expressions being evaluated are represented as [CalculatorExpr]s.
 *
 * The Evaluator holds the expressions and all associated state needed for evaluating
 * them.  It provides functionality for saving and restoring this state.  However the underlying
 * CalculatorExprs are exposed to the client, and may be directly accessed after cancelling any
 * in-progress computations by invoking the cancelAll() method.
 *
 * When evaluation is requested, we invoke the eval() method on the CalculatorExpr from a
 * background AsyncTask.  A subsequent stringGet() call for the same expression index returns
 * immediately, though it may return a result containing placeholder ' ' characters.  If we had to
 * return placeholder characters, we start a background task, which invokes the onReevaluate()
 * callback when it completes.  In either case, the background task computes the appropriate
 * result digits by evaluating the UnifiedReal returned by CalculatorExpr.eval() to the required
 * precision.
 *
 * We cache the best decimal approximation we have already computed.  We compute generously to
 * allow for some scrolling without re-computation and to minimize the chance of digits flipping
 * from "0000" to "9999".  The best known result approximation is maintained as a string by
 * mResultString (and often in a different format by the CR representation of the result).  When
 * we are in danger of not having digits to display in response to further scrolling, we also
 * initiate a background computation to higher precision, as if we had generated placeholder
 * characters.
 *
 * The code is designed to ensure that the error in the displayed result (excluding any
 * placeholder characters) is always strictly less than 1 in the last displayed digit.  Typically
 * we actually display a prefix of a result that has this property and additionally is computed to
 * a significantly higher precision.  Thus we almost always round correctly towards zero.  (Fully
 * correct rounding towards zero is not computable, at least given our representation.)
 *
 * Initial expression evaluation may time out.  This may happen in the case of domain errors such
 * as division by zero, or for large computations.  We do not currently time out reevaluations to
 * higher precision, since the original evaluation precluded a domain error that could result in
 * non-termination.  (We may discover that a presumed zero result is actually slightly negative
 * when re-evaluated; but that results in an exception, which we can handle.)  The user can abort
 * either kind of computation.
 *
 * We ensure that only one evaluation of either kind (AsyncEvaluator or AsyncReevaluator) is
 * running at a time.

         * - It was a timeout: If our [mRequired] field is *true* (user requested a result) and our

         * of the `mLongTimeout` of the [ExprInfo] in [mExprs] at index [mIndex] in order to ask
         * the user if he wants to try a longer timeout value. We then call the `onCancelled` method
         * of [mListener] to report the cancelled evaluation.
         * - A different error: if our [mRequired] field is *true* we set the `mResultString` field

         * No matter which error we just return now.

         * If [result] is not an error we set the `mResultString` field of [mExprInfo] to the
         * `newResultString` field of [result], and the `mResultStringOffset` field to the
         * `newResultStringOffset` field of [result]. We initialize our variable `dotIndex` to the
         * index of the first '.' character in the `mResultString` field of [mExprInfo], and our
         * variable `truncatedWholePart` to the substring of the `mResultString` field of
         * [mExprInfo] between index 0 and index `dotIndex`. We initialize our variable
         * `initPrecOffset` to the `initDisplayOffset` field of [result], then set the `mMsdIndex`
         * field of [mExprInfo] to the most significant digit index returned by our [msdIndexOfGet]
         * method for the `mResultString` field of [mExprInfo]. We then initialize our variable
         * `leastDigOffset` to the index of the rightmost nonzero digit position returned by our
         * [lsdOffsetGet] method for the [UnifiedReal] in the `unifiedReal` field of [result], the
         * current cached decimal string representation in the `mResultString` field of [mExprInfo],
         * and index of decimal point given by `dotIndex`. We then initialize our variable
         * `newInitPrecOffset` to the preferred precision "offset" for the currently displayed result
         * returned by our [preferredPrecGet] method for the `mResultString` field of [mExprInfo],
         * its `mMsdIndex` field, with `leastDigOffset` as the position of the least significant
         * digit, and [mCharMetricsInfo] as the [CharMetricsInfo] in use. If `newInitPrecOffset` is
         * less than `initPrecOffset` we set `initPrecOffset` to `newInitPrecOffset` (if not we just
         * log this anomaly). Finally we call `onEvaluate` override of [mListener] with [mIndex] as
