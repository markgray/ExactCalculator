/**
 * Computable real numbers, represented so that we can get exact decidable comparisons
 * for a number of interesting special cases, including rational computations.
 *
 * A real number is represented as the product of two numbers with different representations:
 * > A) A [BoundedRational] that can only represent a subset of the rationals, but supports
 * > exact computable comparisons.
 *
 * > B) A lazily evaluated "constructive real number" ([CR]) that provides operations to evaluate
 * > itself to any requested number of digits.
 *
 * Whenever possible, we choose (B) to be one of a small set of known constants about which we
 * know more.  For example, whenever we can, we represent rationals such that (B) is 1.
 * This scheme allows us to do some very limited symbolic computation on numbers when both
 * have the same (B) value, as well as in some other situations.  We try to maximize that
 * possibility.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations and operations that produce finite approximations may throw unchecked
 * exceptions produced by the underlying [CR] and [BoundedRational] packages, including
 * [CR.PrecisionOverflowException] and [CR.AbortedException].

         *  and a step size of 2 times [step]. Again if our thread is interupted we throw an
         *  [CR.AbortedException], and if not we return `prod1` multiplied by `prod2`.
         *  - [n] is less than or equal to 4 times [step]: If [n] is 0 we return [BigInteger.ONE],
         *  otherwise we initialize our `var res` to a [BigInteger] with the value of [n], and
         *  initialize our `var i` to [n] minus [step]. We then loop while `i` is greater than 1
         *  setting `res` to `res` times the [BigInteger] value of `i` and subtracting [step] from
         *  `i`. Then when the while loop finishes we return `res` to the caller.
