     * dealing with the possible value in the calculator display we then loop over `i` from 0 *until*
     * `maxIndex` adding *null* entries to `newDataSet` (they will be lazy filled with entries from
     * the database by the [RecyclerView]'s adapter). We initialize our `val isEmpty` to *true* if
     * `newDataSet` is empty (both the display and history are cleared at the moment). We then set
     * the background color of [mRecyclerView] to R.color.empty_history_color (a shade of gray) if
     * `isEmpty` is *true* or to R.color.display_background_color (a dark blue) if it is *false*.
