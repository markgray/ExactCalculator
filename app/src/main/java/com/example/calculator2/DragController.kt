     * bottom padding of [recyclerView], call all the appropriate initialization methods of our
     * [mAnimationController] field and set [mAnimationInitialized] to *true*.
     * - We then update all the properties that we are animating for the current value of [yFraction]
     * for each of the views `result`, `formula`, `date` and `divider`.

     * *false* we call the `initializeDisplayHeight` method of [mAnimationController] to have it
     * initialize itself for the height of the calculator display and set [mAnimationInitialized] to

     * of [recyclerView] to the lowest index of the first ViewHolder to be translated upwards (which
     * is 1 for both an [ResultAnimationController] and [AnimationController], and 0 for an
     * [EmptyAnimationController]):
     * - We initialize our variable `vh2` to the view holder of the child view at index `i` in
     * [recyclerView]
     * - Then if `vh2` is not *null* we initialize our variable `view` to the `itemView` field of
