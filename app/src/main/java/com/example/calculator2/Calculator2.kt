// TODO: Copy & more general paste in formula?  Note that this requires
//       great care: Currently the text version of a displayed formula
//       is not directly useful for re-evaluating the formula later, since
//       it contains ellipses representing subexpressions evaluated with
//       a different degree mode.  Rather than supporting copy from the
//       formula window, we may eventually want to support generation of a
//       more useful text version in a separate window.  It's not clear
//       this is worth the added (code and user) complexity.

     * index the main expression MAIN_INDEX. We call the *setActivity* method of [KeyMaps] to have

     * by finding the view with id R.id.pad_pager, [mDeleteButton] by finding the view with id

     * inside the view with id R.id.pad_operator which has the id R.id.eq if *numberPadEquals* is
     * null or is not VISIBLE. We initialize our variable *decimalPointButton* by finding the view

     * initialize [mInverseToggle] by finding the view with id R.id.toggle_inv and [mModeToggle] by
     * finding the view with id R.id.toggle_mode. We initialize [isOneLine] to true if [mResultText]
     * is INVISIBLE (it is invisible in layout/display_one_line.xml). We fill [mInvertibleButtons]
     * with the views with ids: R.id.fun_sin, R.id.fun_cos, R.id.fun_tan, R.id.fun_ln, R.id.fun_log,
     * and R.id.op_sqrt (these are the invertible transcendental functions) and fill [mInverseButtons]

     * the visibility of the views in [mInvertibleButtons], and [mInverseButtons] are swapped when
     * [mInverseToggle] is used to toggle between them). We initialize [mDragLayout] by finding the

     * callback (just in case -- we don't want to be called twice), call its *addDragCallback* method
     * to add *this* as a callback, and call its *setCloseCallback* method to add *this* as a
     * *CloseCallback*. We call the *setOnContextMenuClickListener* method of [mFormulaText] to set
     * its [OnFormulaContextMenuClickListener] to [mOnFormulaContextMenuClickListener], call its
     * *setOnDisplayMemoryOperationsListener* method to set its [OnDisplayMemoryOperationsListener]
     * to *this* and call its *addTextChangedListener* to add [mFormulaTextWatcher] as a [TextWatcher].
     * We set the [OnLongClickListener] of [mDeleteButton] to *this* (a long click on it will clear

     * characters we call our [addChars] method to add the character represented by the key with id
     * *id* to the end of our current expression as an uninterpreted character, otherwise we call our

     * from the expression if the key id is R.id.op_sub, and call our method [redisplayAfterFormulaChange]
     * to redisplay our changed formula.
     *
     * For all keys which fall through the *when* block without returning we call our method

     * the result already contains the text to be expanded.
     *

     * play together [ObjectAnimator]s which scale [mResultText] by *resultScale* in both X and Y
     * directions, translate it in the Y direction by *resultTranslationY*, animate its *textColor*
     * to *formulaTextColor*, and translate [mFormulaContainer] by *formulaTranslationY* in the Y
     * direction. We set its duration to the system resource constant config_longAnimTime (500ms) and
     * add an anonymous [AnimatorListenerAdapter] whose *onAnimationEnd* override sets our state to
     * RESULT and sets [mCurrentAnimator] to null. We then set [mCurrentAnimator] to *animatorSet*
     * and start it running.

     * been used to enter text or when pasting a clip that another app has copied to the clipboard,
     * it is not used when a history entry is pasted.
     *
     * First we initialize our variable *myMoreChars* to [moreChars]. If [mUnprocessedChars] is not
     * null we prepend it so *myMoreChars*. We initialize our variable *current* to 0, initialize our
     * variable *len* to the length of *myMoreChars*, and initialize our variable *lastWasDigit* to
     * *false*. If [mCurrentState] is RESULT and *len* is not equal to 0 we call our method
     * *switchToInput* with the *current* (currently 0, aka the first) character of *myMoreChars*
     * translated by the *keyForChar* method of [KeyMaps] to a keypad resource id (*switchToInput*
     * will switch to INPUT state after having [mEvaluator] modify the main expression appropriately
     * given the button id passed it and the present contents of the main expression).
     *
     * We initialize our variable *groupingSeparator* with the 0'th (first) character returned by
     * the *translateResult* method of [KeyMaps] for the string "," (which is ',' aka the grouping
     * separator). Then while *current* is less than *len* we loop:
     *
     * We initialize our variable *c* with the character at index *current* in *myMoreChars*. If *c*
     * is a space character or is equal to *groupingSeparator* we just increment *current* and skip
     * the character by continuing the loop. Otherwise we initialize our variable *k* with the button
     * id of the keypad button that the *keyForChar* method of [KeyMaps] finds for *c* (it returns
     * View.NO_ID if there is no such button). If our parameter [explicit] is false (the text was
     * pasted, not typed) we initialize our variable *expEnd* with the index of the character after
     * the exponent in *myMoreChars* starting at *current*. If *lastWasDigit* is true and *current*
     * is not equal to *expEnd* we need to process scientific notation with 'E' when pasting so we
     * call the *addExponent* method of [mEvaluator] to have it add the characters *current* to
     * *expEnd* of *myMoreChars* as an exponend of the current expression, we then set *current* to
     * *expEnd*, set *lastWasDigit to *false* and continue the while loop. Otherwise we initialize
     * our variable *isDigit* to *true* if the *digVal* of [KeyMaps] says *k* is one of the decimal
     * keys on the keypad (it returns NOT_DIGIT if it is not). Then if *current* is 0, and *isDigit*
     * is *true* or *k* is R.id.dec_point and the main expression of [mEvaluator] has a trailing
     * *Constant* we refuse to add *k* to it, adding the key R.id.op_mul (multiply) before dealing
     * with *k* later on in the loop. In either case we set *lastWasDigit* to *isDigit* or the
     * previous value of *lastWasDigit* when *k* is R.id.dec_point.
     *
     * Then if *k* is not View.NO_ID, we set [mCurrentButton] to the view with id *k*. If our parameter
     * [explicit] is *true* we call our [addExplicitKeyToExpr] to add *k* to the expression, otherwise
     * we call our method [addKeyToExpr] to add *k* to the expression. If *c* is a Unicode surrogate
     * code unit we add 2 to *current*, otherwise we add 1 to it, and then we continue the while loop.
     *
     * If we have got this far in the loop we know that *k* is NO_ID, so we need to see if *myMoreChars*
     * contains a function name so we initialize our variable *f* with the value that the *funForString*
     * method returns after examining *myMoreChars* to see if a function name starts at *current* (it
     * returns View.NO_ID if a key is not found for the string, or the resource id of the key if it
     * finds one). Then if *f* is not View.NO_ID, we set [mCurrentButton] to the view with id *f*.
     * If our parameter [explicit] is *true* we call our method [addExplicitKeyToExpr] to add *f* to
     * the expression, otherwise we call our method [addKeyToExpr] to add *f* to the expression. If
     * *f* is R.id.op_sqrt we call our method [addKeyToExpr] to add a R.id.lparen to the expression.
     * We then set *current* to one plus the index in *myMoreChars* of the '(' character of the
     * function invocation, and continue the loop.
     *
     * At this point in the loop there are characters left, but we can't convert them to button presses
     * so we set [mUnprocessedChars] to the characters from *current* to the end of *myMoreChars*, call
     * our method [redisplayAfterFormulaChange] to redisplay the formula, call our method
     * [showOrHideToolbar] to show the tool bar and auto-hide it when appropriate, then return to the
     * caller.
     *
