     * character in [s] is either an '-' or an ' ' character we increment `current` to skip it.
     * We then append the characters between [begin] and `current` in [s] to `result`. Next we loop
     * while `current` is less than [end] appending the `current` character in [s] to `result` then
     * incrementing `current`. If the characters remaining ([end] minus `current`) modulo 3 is 0 and
     * [end] is not equal to `current` we also append a ',' character to `result`.

     * - We increment `wIndex` as long as the `wIndex` character of [whole] is [c].
     * - If `pIndex` is equal to `pLen` we break out of the loop.
