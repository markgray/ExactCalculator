     * Implement this method to intercept all touch screen motion events. This allows you to watch

     *
     * Using this function takes some care, as it has a fairly complicated interaction with
     * [onTouchEvent], and using it requires implementing that method as well as this one in
     * the correct way. Events will be received in the following order:
     * - You will receive the down event here.
     * - The down event will be handled either by a child of this view group, or given to your own
     * [onTouchEvent] method to handle; this means you should implement [onTouchEvent] to return
     * *true*, so you will continue to see the rest of the gesture (instead of looking for a parent
     * view to handle it). Also, by returning *true* from [onTouchEvent], you will not receive any
     * following events in [onInterceptTouchEvent] and all touch processing must happen in
     * onTouchEvent like normal.
     * - For as long as you return *false* from this function, each following event (up to and
     * including the final up) will be delivered first here and then to the target's [onTouchEvent].
     * - If you return true from here, you will not receive any following events: the target view
     * will receive the same event but with the action ACTION_CANCEL, and all further events will be
     * delivered to your [onTouchEvent] method and no longer appear here.
     *
     * Wrapped in a try block intended to catch and log IllegalArgumentException, we first check
     * whether we are accessibility focused or our super's implementation of `onInterceptTouchEvent`
     * returns *true* and if either are *true* we return *true* to intercept the touch event (we do
     * this because otherwise they will be incorrectly offset by a11y before being dispatched to
     * children, and the call to our super's implementation is to give it a chance to intercept the
     * event).
     *
     * Otherwise we initialize our variable `action` with the masked off action of [ev]. If `action`
     * is ACTION_DOWN (a pressed gesture has started) or ACTION_POINTER_DOWN (a non-primary pointer
     * has gone down) we need to check if any of our children are a11y focused:
     * - We initialize our variable `childCount` to our `childCount` property.
     * - We loop over `childIndex` from our last child down to our first and if any of these children
     * are accessibility focused we set our [mClickedItemIndex] field to that `childIndex` and return
     * *true* to intercept the event (the `onSingleTapUp` override of our [GestureDetector] instance
     * [mGestureWatcher] will pass the event to the child's `performClick` method).
     *
     * If none of our children are a11y focused we need to check if the touch is on a non-current
     * item that we want to intercept:
     * - We initialize our variable `actionIndex` with the `actionIndex` field of [ev].
     * - We initialize our variable `x` with the X coordinate of the `actionIndex` pointer index of
     * [ev] plus our `scrollX` property (the scrolled left position of this view: the left edge of
     * the displayed part of our view) and our variable `y` with the Y coordinate of the `actionIndex`
     * pointer index of [ev] plus our `scrollY` property (the top edge of the displayed part of our
     * view).
     * - We loop over `i` from our last child down to our first:
     *     - We initialize our variable `childIndex` to the drawing order of the child to draw for
     *     iteration `i`, and initialize our variable `child` to the child at `childIndex`.
     *     - If the `child` is visible and `x` and `y` are within the coordinates of `child` we
     *     check if `action` is ACTION_DOWN and if it is we set `mClickedItemIndex` to `childIndex`.
     *     Then we return *true* if `childIndex` is not equal to the `currentItem` property of our
     *     `ViewPager` (the currently selected page) otherwise we return *false*
     *
     * If we did not steal the touch event in the above code, we return *false* to continue the
     * normal touch event handling.
     *
     * @param ev The motion event being dispatched down the hierarchy.
