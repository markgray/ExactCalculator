/**
 * A mathematical expression represented as a sequence of "tokens".
 * Many tokens are represented by button ids for the corresponding operator.
 * A token may also represent the result of a previously evaluated expression.
 * The [add] method adds a token to the end of the expression.  The [delete] method removes one.
 * [clear] deletes the entire expression contents. [eval] evaluates the expression,
 * producing a [UnifiedReal] result.
 * Expressions are parsed only during evaluation; no explicit parse tree is maintained.
 *
 * The [write] method is used to save the current expression.  Note that neither [UnifiedReal]
 * nor the underlying [CR] provide a serialization facility.  Thus we save all previously
 * computed values by writing out the expression that was used to compute them, and reevaluate
